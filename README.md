ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m NicolÃ¡s Comay.

I'm a PhD student at the PhD in Neurosciences program of the [National University of CÃ³rdoba (Argentina)](https://www.unc.edu.ar/english/).

At the [Cognitive Science Group](https://cognitivesciences.github.io/), I'm studying metacognition: the ability to reflect upon our own cognitive processes. In order to understand this phenomenon, we use behavioral experiments, computational modeling and some psychophysiological techniques (such as eye-tracking).

You can reach me at nicocomay@gmail.com, or if you are in CÃ³rdoba you can directly visit me at the lab!
