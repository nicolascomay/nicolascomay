ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m NicolÃ¡s Comay.

I'm a PhD student at the PhD in Neurosciences program of the [National University of CÃ³rdoba (Argentina)](https://www.unc.edu.ar/english/).

I'm studying metacognition, the ability to reflect upon our own cognitive processes, through behavioral experiments and computational modeling.  

You can reach me at nicocomay@gmail.com, or if you are in CÃ³rdoba you can directly visit me at [the lab](https://cognitivesciences.github.io/).
